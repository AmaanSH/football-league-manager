# football-league-manager
As apart of my object orinted module of my coursework I had to create a Football League manager, this was the brief:

```
Your task is to design and implement a prototype system that enables the football league to keep track of its teams. Your system should provide the following functionality. 

* Your system should allow the league to:
* Add or remove players from its list of players
* Add or remove a team from the teamâ€™s list of teams
* Add or remove games
* Allocate a team to a game and select which players are in the line-up
* Create a new match with its corresponding venue and date
* Modify the status of a player
* Show details for teams, matches, and players

All information must be stored in objects and must persist between sessions

Access to the facilities of your system should be via a GUI-based application that appears on the screen as a stand-alone application
```

Throughout development I had to ensure the SOLID principles and OOP practices were being met.
